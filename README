This processing program is a re-creation of Camille Utterback's "Text Rain" (1999) using processing. In my version, lines from Guillaume Apollinaire's poem "Il pleut" (it rains) fall from the top of the screen, and you can catch them with your body. 

Thanks to Mike Taylor & John Gruen (carnegie mellon) for nudges in the right direction.
